Intel Tiber Developer Cloud – Resource ComputePool Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Use Cases for Resource ComputePools

- User Assignment & Reservation
  Servers are assigned to users to help PMs reserve and allocate to customers and Liftoff teams.
  Goal: Ensure customers receive what they’ve paid for.

- Node ComputePool Administration
  - Admins of a node ComputePool can assign users/accounts to that ComputePool.
  - ITAC Admins can create high-level node ComputePools.

- Break-Fix and Debugging
  Cordoning servers enables internal teams to conduct break-fix and debugging efforts.

- Dedicated ComputePools
  - Specific ComputePools for Customer Zero and Intel Labs.
  - Quarantine ComputePools for temporarily deactivated healthy nodes.


2. Node ComputePool Lifecycle & Hierarchy

- Transition Flow
  - Nodes start in Customer Zero Ready.
  - Once signed off by Customer Zero, they transition to General.
  - If a node is meant for a specific customer, it bypasses General.

- Exception Handling
  - Scenario: A node assigned to a customer fails and moves to Maintenance.
  - Action Needed: Document how to restore the node to its original customer post-recovery.

4. Special Notes: CMH02 / G3

- All nodes not ready or in Maintenance are tagged accordingly.
- Lifecycle Flow:
  General → Maintenance → Cust Zero → General
- PoC Customer Nodes:
  Eventually transition to General ComputePool.
